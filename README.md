# IT Helpdesk Ticket Resolution System

This codebase implements an **IT Helpdesk Ticket Resolution System** designed to streamline the resolution of helpdesk tickets by leveraging past ticket information and AI-generated suggestions. The app is live and can be accessed [here](https://grjtzb38rvrjlw4hbpfhx3.streamlit.app/).

## Main Components

### 1. Data Loading
The `DataLoader` class loads ticket data from multiple formats (CSV, XLSX, JSON) into a pandas DataFrame, standardizes column names, and ensures correct data types.

### 2. Ticket Management
The `TicketManager` class manages all ticket operations such as fetching, adding, and resolving tickets, while also validating the data through a Pydantic `Ticket` model.

### 3. Similarity Engine
This engine utilizes TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to find tickets similar to a newly added one, providing context and relevant historical data.

### 4. AI Suggestion Engine
The `AISuggestionEngine` integrates with Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's GPT or Aleph Alpha’s models to offer AI-generated suggestions based on the identified similar tickets.

### 5. API
The system includes a FastAPI backend to expose endpoints for tasks like ticket creation, similarity searches, and AI-powered suggestions.

### 6. User Interface
The user interface is built using Streamlit, providing a clean and interactive browser-based GUI for ticket management.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Data Flow
- Ticket data is loaded via the `DataLoader` into a pandas DataFrame.
- When a new ticket arrives, the `TicketManager` processes it and calls the `SimilarityEngine` to find related tickets.
- AI-based suggestions are generated by the `AISuggestionEngine` and displayed for the agent to review and resolve.
- Agents interact with the system via either API or the Streamlit UI.

### 2. AI Integration
The system is integrated with OpenAI and Aleph Alpha for AI-based suggestions. Configuration allows users to select their preferred provider.

### 3. Ticket Resolution Process
Agents can view new tickets, assess similar past tickets, and review AI-generated suggestions. Upon resolving a ticket, agents can provide feedback to improve the system.

## Assumptions
- Data is assumed to be small enough to be managed in memory via pandas.
- Only resolved tickets are used in the similarity engine and for AI suggestions.
- Feedback on AI suggestions is not incorporated into future suggestions.

## Shortcomings

1. **Data Management**: The system stores ticket data in-memory using pandas DataFrames, which could be inefficient for larger datasets. Introducing a database backend like PostgreSQL or MySQL would improve performance and scalability.
   
2. **Deployment**: The app currently runs locally after installation. Deploying the system in a Docker container with Docker Compose to manage dependencies (e.g., database, API) would simplify deployment, especially for production environments or internal networks.

3. **Concurrency**: The app doesn’t employ asynchronous functionality, which limits performance when handling multiple requests. This was done to simplify development but impacts scalability.

4. **Testing**: There is no CI/CD pipeline or automated testing, making it harder to ensure code stability and reliability as the project evolves.

5. **Evaluation**: The system does not incorporate an evaluation mechanism for AI-generated responses. Feedback on AI suggestions is stored but not used to improve the TF-IDF model or retrain the AI.

## Future Improvements
- **Database Integration**: Switch from in-memory data storage to a relational database for better data persistence and performance.
- **Containerization**: Implement Docker and Docker Compose for easier deployment and management of necessary services.
- **Async Functionality**: Introduce asynchronous operations to improve response times under heavy loads.
- **Testing & CI/CD**: Develop unit tests and integrate a CI/CD pipeline for more reliable updates.
- **AI Feedback Loop**: Incorporate feedback from resolved tickets into the AI model to improve future suggestions.

# Aleph Alpha AI Solutions Engineer Case Study

Congratulations on making it to the case study round! We appreciate your time and effort so far and are really excited to see what you will come up with during this case study. During this round, we will present you with a case study to give you the opportunity to showcase your skills. It will be open-ended, and you will have the freedom to tackle the problem as you please.

## Deliverables
There are two sets of deliverables and a presentation:
- Code Artifact: Present a solution that goes beyond a simple Python script. For example, this could be in the form of a simple API, a Gradio/Streamlit app, or a Python package. Be creative!
- Documentation: Document your assumptions, approach, and considerations while you work on the problem. Include all the results of your experimentation and the shortcomings of your solution. Give a brief explanation of how you would proceed if you had more time.
- Presentation: You should be prepared to present your code artifact and documentation to us in some form. You will have 20 minutes to present your solution, and we will reserve the remaining time for questions. Please note that you don't need to prepare any extra slides. A walkthrough of the code artifact and documentation are sufficient.

## What we are providing
- API Credits: You will receive free credits for our API. The steps to receive your free credits for this case study should be in the email you received along with the link to this repository. Please contact us if you need more credits than were initially provided.
- AA API-Documentation: You can find Aleph Alpha's documentation [here](https://docs.aleph-alpha.com/docs/category/introduction/). For code snippets of the various endpoints in our API, please refer to [this](https://docs.aleph-alpha.com/docs/category/tasks/) part of the documentation.
- Data: Navigate to the `data/`folder in the repository to find the data you need for the task. In `old_tickets` you will find tickets that have been resolved before and in `new_tickets.csv` you will find tickets that you can use test and evaluate your solution.

## Case Background
You are working at Aleph Alpha as an AI Solutions Engineer. You have a client who runs IT helpdesks for different companies. A lot of the tickets the client handles are redundant and might just need a little tweak to solve the problem of the client's customer. For each previously resolved ticket, there is a description of how the problem was solved. The issue is that service agents often don't know if and how a problem has been solved before by someone else. Therefore, the client wants to build a new feature that would assist their agents while working on incoming new tickets, utilizing the information from tickets that have been resolved before. The goal is to use previous tickets to aid the agent in finding a solution for incoming new tickets.

Hint: You don't need to provide a solution to the agent; it is enough to provide a direction that might lead the agent to solving the ticket.

## Task
First, we are interested in the steps you would take to understand the problem and propose a solution. Second, use the tools of your choice to build a simple prototype that could assist the agent. We will provide a "database" of previous tickets that have been solved and some tickets that you can evaluate your prototype on. The focus of the task should be more on the approach and considerations you make than the quality of the final output. Please don't spend more than 3-5 hours on this task, but rather tell us what more you could have done if you had more time.

Hint: Use your time wisely; an imperfect solution is better than an incomplete solution.

## Tools available
You can use any tool of your choice, but the solution must include some form of Aleph Alpha's technology stack (eg. API).
