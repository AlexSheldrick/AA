# IT Helpdesk Ticket Resolution System

This codebase implements an **IT Helpdesk Ticket Resolution System** designed to streamline the resolution of helpdesk tickets by leveraging past ticket information and AI-generated suggestions. The app is live and can be accessed [here](https://grjtzb38rvrjlw4hbpfhx3.streamlit.app/).

## Main Components

### 1. Data Loading
The `DataLoader` class loads ticket data from multiple formats (CSV, XLSX, JSON) into a pandas DataFrame, standardizes column names, and ensures correct data types.

### 2. Ticket Management
The `TicketManager` class manages all ticket operations such as fetching, adding, and resolving tickets, while also validating the data through a Pydantic `Ticket` model.

### 3. Similarity Engine
This engine utilizes TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to find tickets similar to a newly added one, providing context and relevant historical data.

### 4. AI Suggestion Engine
The `AISuggestionEngine` integrates with Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's GPT or Aleph Alpha’s models to offer AI-generated suggestions based on the identified similar tickets.

### 5. API
The system includes a FastAPI backend to expose endpoints for tasks like ticket creation, similarity searches, and AI-powered suggestions.

### 6. User Interface
The user interface is built using Streamlit, providing a clean and interactive browser-based GUI for ticket management.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Data Flow
- Ticket data is loaded via the `DataLoader` into a pandas DataFrame.
- When a new ticket arrives, the `TicketManager` processes it and calls the `SimilarityEngine` to find related tickets.
- AI-based suggestions are generated by the `AISuggestionEngine` and displayed for the agent to review and resolve.
- Agents interact with the system via either API or the Streamlit UI.

### 2. AI Integration
The system is integrated with OpenAI and Aleph Alpha for AI-based suggestions. Configuration allows users to select their preferred provider.

### 3. Ticket Resolution Process
Agents can view new tickets, assess similar past tickets, and review AI-generated suggestions. Upon resolving a ticket, agents can provide feedback to improve the system.

## Assumptions
- Data is assumed to be small enough to be managed in memory via pandas.
- Only resolved tickets are used in the similarity engine and for AI suggestions.
- Feedback on AI suggestions is not incorporated into future suggestions.

## Shortcomings

1. **Data Management**: The system stores ticket data in-memory using pandas DataFrames, which could be inefficient for larger datasets. Introducing a database backend like PostgreSQL or MySQL would improve performance and scalability.
   
2. **Deployment**: The app currently runs locally after installation. Deploying the system in a Docker container with Docker Compose to manage dependencies (e.g., database, API) would simplify deployment, especially for production environments or internal networks.

3. **Concurrency**: The app doesn’t employ asynchronous functionality, which limits performance when handling multiple requests. This was done to simplify development but impacts scalability.

4. **Testing**: There is no CI/CD pipeline or automated testing, making it harder to ensure code stability and reliability as the project evolves.

5. **Evaluation**: The system does not incorporate an evaluation mechanism for AI-generated responses. Feedback on AI suggestions is stored but not used to improve the TF-IDF model or retrain the AI.

## Future Improvements
- **Database Integration**: Switch from in-memory data storage to a relational database for better data persistence and performance.
- **Containerization**: Implement Docker and Docker Compose for easier deployment and management of necessary services.
- **Async Functionality**: Introduce asynchronous operations to improve response times under heavy loads.
- **Testing & CI/CD**: Develop unit tests and integrate a CI/CD pipeline for more reliable updates.
- **AI Feedback Loop**: Incorporate feedback from resolved tickets into the AI model to improve future suggestions.
